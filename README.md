# ParkerGAskingQuestionsEndpoint

This program takes the user's name and time they woke up from the user through the URL, inserts them in to a response and displays it in the endpoint 

To run this program, type this, replacing the 'xxxx' with where your local host is located, as well as adding your name and what time you woke up at the end

https://localhost:xxxx/AskingQuestions/AskingQuestions/{name}/{time}

# Peer Review - Chris Martinez
I was able to type in a name, along with the time, and it populated a sentence that read my name and the time I woke up.
it was also nice to see that there was a local host https included on the comments, of the controller. Way to go Griffin.
